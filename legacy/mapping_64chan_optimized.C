THIS MACRO WAS WRITEN TO PRODUCE A MULTIPLEX MAP THAT OPTIMALLY MAP
64 CHANNEL TO 320 STRIPS FOLLOWING THE ADVISE OF SEBASTIEN PROCUREUR.
HERE IS THE MAIL THAT WAS SENT BY HIM:


Dear Emilio,
Thanks for all the interesting info. I had a quick look at the mapping, so the multiplexing sequence is {1,7,13,19,25}. That sounds good a priori, as all these numbers are prime with 64, however there is indeed a repetition between the group 13 and 19, where the sequence reads:
50 63 12 25 38 51 0 19 38 57 12 31 50
This sequence is doubly bad: first, there is a very quick repetition of channel 38, which is connected to 2 strips (nÂ° 190 and 194) separated by only 3 intermediate strips (distance =4). Second (and less important), other channels are repeated every other 2 strips, i.e. channels 12, 50, etc.  
I guess it is at this position you have ambiguities, right?

If you want to keep the same number of channels and strips, I propose you the following multiplexing sequence: {1,13,29,17,21}. In this case you should not see any pair of strips connected to the same channel and distant by less than 16 strips (you can check :) ). More specifically:
- the closest repetition from groupe 1 and 13 has distance 16 (channel 52)
- the closest repetition from groupe 13 and 29 has distance 16 (channel 11)
- the closest repetition from groupe 29 and 17 has distance 16 (channel 12)
- the closest repetition from groupe 17 and 21 has distance 16 (channel 60)
From what I see, it seems to be the best possible sequence for the configuration with 64 channels and multiplexing by 5.

Cheers,
Se
